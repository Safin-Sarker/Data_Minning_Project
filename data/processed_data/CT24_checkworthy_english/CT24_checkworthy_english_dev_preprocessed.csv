5609,But there is no doubt that weve been living beyond our means and were going to have to make some adjustments,No

5773,So I want to tell you we will run a truthful campaign,No
5774,This is a tough campaign,No
5778,And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision you didnt tell the American people the truth because you didnt,Yes
5779,And thats thats thats an unfortunate part,No
5780,Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obamas campaign than any time since Watergate,Yes
5783,Well look you know I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough,No
5784,I think that if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people Bob your network just did a poll showing that twothirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus onethird of mine,Yes
5788,And now I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply,No
5815,Youve got to read what he said,No
5823,The important point here is though the American people have become so cynical about our politics because all they see is a tit fortat and backandforth,No

5993,We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on,No
5996,But I also believe that for far too long certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement,No

6164,Thats not appropriate to do,No
6168,I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states,No

6399,In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future,No
6402,And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House,No

7389,Well I respect everything that the president has said and certainly respect his faith,No

7596,There isnt any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if its attacked,No
7600,In the first place Ive never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present,Yes
7637,But when the president of the United States is doing something thats right something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody including Mr Khrushchev,No
7650,I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment,No
7653,Second in the field of schools we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools,No
7657,Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody,No

8422,Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then,No
8437,My objection here is not the cost in dollars,No

8533,Thats why we have to continue to be alert,No
8546,Now that isnt the test of whether America moves,No
8551,Now the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved the reason that weve had the funds for example locally to build the schools and the hospitals and the highways to make the progress that we have is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eightyear period,Yes
8562,I think thats the big assignment the big task the big function of the federal government,No

8835,But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly,No
8876,We have also provided in our program for a billion Community Trust Fund and weve told you where the money is coming from,Yes

11081,But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation,No
11094,And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda,No
11112,And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out then I think that we have to act and we will take them out,No
11130,And that is to get the support of the people,No
11132,And by working and coordinating our efforts together not threatening to attack them but working with them and where necessary use force but talk softly but carry a big stick,No
11145,Itd be fine with me,No
11191,We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time because were going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan,No

11234,And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken,No
11235,But we cant just provide moral support,No
11240,The other thing we have to do though is weve got to see around the corners,No
11266,And Georgia and Ukraine are both major gateways of energy into Europe,Yes
11277,Well thank you Terry,No
11278,And thank you for your service to the country,No
11293,And I think we can do that,No
11295,But at the end of the day my friend I have to tell you again and you know what its like to serve and you know what its like to sacrifice but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place,No

11302,And I will do everything thats required to prevent it,No
11313,Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to,Yes

12557,And so we need military strength we need economic strength we also need the right diplomatic policies,No

12574,I voted for the Formosa resolution in,Yes

15491,And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the of January as possible to fight that war,No
15525,You know the American people are fair,No
15527,They want to judge it on the record itself,No

15626,As a matter of fact Im the first governor in the history of my state to fund that pension system and Im very proud of that,Yes
15632,I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way,No
15633,So I hope and expect that I will be liked by the people of this country as president of the United States I certainly hope I will be liked by them on the of November,No
15638,So that pledge isnt realistic and I think the vice president knows it I think the people of this country know it,No
15640,And I am going to be a president who is serious I hope and expect will be liked by the American people,No
15641,But more than that to do the kind of job that Im elected to do will do it with as much good humor as I can but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people,No
15645,I think its whether you share the broad dreams of the American people whether you have confidence in the peoples ability to get things done or whether you think it all should be turned over as many of the liberals do to Washington DC You see I think its a question of values not likability or loveability its a question in foreign affairs in experience knowing world leaders knowing how to build on a superb record of this administration in arms control because youd know exactly how to begin,No
15646,You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace,No
15648,It is though trying to understand the heartbeat of the country,No
15682,Its our vision of America,No
15686,I think this is a great country because weve always wanted to do better to make our country better to make our lives better,No
15689,Thats the kind of leadership I want to provide,No
15690,But I dont think these labels mean a thing and I would hope that tonight in the course of the rest of this campaign we can have good solid disagreements on issues,No
15718,They continue to modernize and we cant simply weve got enough nuclear weapons lets freeze,No
15726,Now my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with those decisions but its going to be the President whos going to have to ultimately decide before that budget goes to the Congress what weapons systems are going to go and what are going to stay,No
15730,Those are decisions that the chief executive has to make,No
15731,Yes were going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent,No
15750,So military security and economic security go hand in hand,No
15751,And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent,No
15763,Can we start the clock over,No
15787,Some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to me,No
15789,We were proud of them,No
15796,But more than that they are role models,No
15801,These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month,No
15810,And theres nothing corny about having sports heroes young people that are clean and honorable and out there setting the pace,No
15829,I had something very nice to say in there,No
15842,And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect,No
15856,I salute those who participate in the political process,No
15874,We may have different approaches,No
15881,the tone weve just heard might just be the tone we have for the rest of the campaign,No
15905,But thats the way I George Bush feel about it,No
15930,Its not going to happen overnight it certainly will have to happen on a stepbystep basis as we make progress in arms negotiation and arms control and arms reduction,No
15933,The defense budget today takes far less percentage of the gross national product than it did in President Kennedys time for example moved tremendously,Yes
15937,See I dont believe any other country can pick up the mantel,No
15938,I served at the UN,No
15939,I dont think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the United Nations or anything else,No
15947,We dont give away our hand before we sit down at the head table,No
15987,The Congress is doing a better job of it,No
15989,But they dont work if you go raise taxes and then the Congress spends it continues to spend that,No
16006,And there are several theres a good political reason because its just about this time of year that the Democrats start saying the Republicans are going to take away your Social Security,No
16014,I learned that the hard way and the Governor and I both supported slipping the COLAs for one year,Yes
16015,He supported it at the National Governors Conference and I supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that,Yes
16017,We do not have to do it,No
16044,I wont support judges like that,No
16046,But I will go out there and find men and women to interpret,No
16047,And I dont have a list but I think the appointments that the President has made to the Bench have been outstanding outstanding appointments,No
16075,Now twothirds of the people in this country who receive Social Security checks live entirely on that check they have no other income,Yes
16093,But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems particularly that affect our children,No
16099,Were going to tell you how to do it all,No
16101,You ought to go out and see around this country whats happening in the volunteer section Americans helping America,No
16116,I just have to correct the record,No
16128,But as we look at the decisions that the next president of the United States is going to have to make I just dont believe the place you go first is those programs those socalled entitlements which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of medical care for the elderly the disabled for people who cant make their way on their own and in many cases have given a great deal to this country,No
16131,Its a contract between generations,No
16154,We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn and therefore create a bigger market for our agricultural products,Yes
16184,So Ill just keep saying I am one,No
16186,Im not going to do that,No
16187,That boo was excessively loud,No
16193,I believe in our parks,No
16227,I will not agree to another debate,No
16233,In terms of negative campaigning you know I dont want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard he started it,No
16236,But Ill try harder to keep it on a high plane,No
16246,But its not getting out because there are too few debates,No
16256,Isnt that the point,No
16257,Most Americans believe in basic values,No
16258,We have differences about how to achieve them,No
16263,But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues I think we will have a good success,No
16269,But we also need wellequipped and welltrained and wellsupported conventional forces,No
16274,Lets get him working on Syria their client state and see if we cant get them to join Israel and other Arab nations if at all possible and Arab leaders in finally bringing peace to that troubled region,No
16275,And I think thats one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East,No
16276,Lets go to work and end this fiasco in Central America a failed policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet influence,No
16281,And weve got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere and go to work on our single most important problem and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries,No
16307,Maybe the Vice President has an answer,No
16308,But Im somebody who believes very strongly in taking care of the fundamentals first before you start new stuff,No
16313,Maybe in Idaho to take care of the requirements nuclear material requirements for our Defense Department,No
16315,This sounds like real progress here because weve had a big difference on the safe use of nuclear power for our energy base,No
16316,I believe that we must use clean safe nuclear power,No
16320,So I am one who believes that we can,No
16332,I believe that public service is honorable,No

16408,And I ask for your support on November,No
16410,Working together we can do wonderful things for the United States and the Free World,No
16467,Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh debates and these are the kind of programs that Ill talk about on my time,No
16502,When Mr Ford first became president in in August of the first thing he did in in October was to ask for a billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession since uh since the great depression of nineteen uh of the,Yes
16509,And this is why a tax reform is so important,No
16528,I believe that its accurate to say that that the that the committees to whom you refer with the the employment that you uh state and with the to and a half percent growth rate in our economy that the uh projections would be a uh a billion increase in the amount of money that wed have to spend in compared to now,Yes
16579,But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the uh pardon or the amnesty of uh those who evaded the draft but but whether or not our crime system is is fair,No
16600,We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members,No
16615,The last year I was in office uh our budget was was actually less than it was a year before uh which showed a great uh improvement,Yes
16626,We uh have got to do that at the federal government level,No
16631,In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment,Yes
16674,Well keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those qualityoflife programs which I think are needed and necessary,No

16699,Well among my other experiences in the past Ive Ive been a nuclear engineer and did graduate work in this field,No
16782,Congress has sustained fortytwo vetoes,Yes
16828,Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed proposed by Mr Nixon to encourage exports,No
16847,So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief would you in fact do away with all business deductions and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with,No
16851,I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living or who are presently required to list all their income,No
16853,And this is uh the point of my first statistics that I gave you that that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years fifty years by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich,Yes
16857,Governor Carters answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago,Yes
16882,But I think the feeling is misplaced,No
16896,Thats where the problem is and I hope therell be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States,No
16909,If we have a Democratic Congress next year and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year with more programs we will have in my judgment greater deficits with more spending more dangers of inflation,No
16927,I might go back to one other thing,No
16988,But I think its time to talk about the future,No
16991,Its a time to draw ourselves together to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change cooperating for a change in the open for a change so the people can understand their own government,No
16996,I believe in our country,No

17034,We must make this next century the century of the individual,No
17110,At the same time if we can have a recovery continue through that same period of time that will mean without an increase in tax rates that will mean billion more in government revenues,Yes
17111,And so I think that the lines can meet,No
17121,As a matter of fact over years theyve missed the mark by nearly billion,Yes
17134,I think this is a test of leadership and I think the American people know the difference,No
17138,Absolutely and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over years but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things applause that people need,Yes

17361,The American people want to keep opening doors,No
17389,I said that we would create jobs for our people and we did million in the last or months,Yes

17434,As a matter of fact there has been less than onequarter of percent of foreclosures of the loans from government that the farmers have,Yes
17476,This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated,No

17506,Youve got another life involved,No
17509,Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment,No
17523,But in this great society of ours wouldnt it make a lot more sense in this gentle and kind society if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child that instead we make it available for the adoption,No
17550,In my opinion as we deal with this deficit people from about a year on down have to be dealt with very very carefully because they are the ones who didnt get any relief the first time around,Yes

17686,I think the President genuinely believes that theyre better off,No
17692,We are now billion of imports million jobs lost and farmers are having their worst year,Yes
17695,I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent,No
17721,Theres no way of glossing around that,No
17749,But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training,No
17766,Will you finally touch that defense budget,No
17773,Ill tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog both in this campaign and the one in,No
