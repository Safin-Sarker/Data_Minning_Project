95,And so I think its about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective,No
26977,Well of course I dont concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that Ive said,No
20390,He said all poor seniors,No

620,These are themy answer is do not make these unilateral cuts and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works and so this is where I have a big difference,No

22136,We have to have our people at work,No
8431,But as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers salaries,Yes
